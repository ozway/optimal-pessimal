ecoli.fasta is the ecoli genome
xobs.bmat is generated by the cubfits package. It has the delta eta values

findcodons.r reads the xobs.bmat file to find the codons with the highest and lowest pausing time (Ribosome Overhead Cost, ROC)

makePessimal.r takes in ecoli.fasta and makes a version with the longest pausing time (ROC)
makeOptimal.r takes in ecoli.fasta and makes a version with the shortest pausing time (ROC)
makeOptimal.r takes in ecoli.fasta and makes both versions

By default, the optimal genome is written to optimalEcoli.fasta,
	while the pessimal genome is written to pessimalEcoli.fasta



writing.r contains functions copied from the cubfits package
