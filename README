What this is:
	This is an R script that takes the output from the cubfits package (Codon Usage Bias FITS) and generates and generates the optimal and pessimal version of a given genome.


------------
	------------
		------------

How to run it:

	Rscript makeOptimal.r
		or
	Rscript makePessimal.r
		or, to be really fancy 
	Rscript makeBoth.r

	makeOptimal and makePessimal took around 5-6 minutes on Gauley, makeBoth took around 8.

What you'll need / What's Inside:
 - config.r
 - ecoli.fasta
 - etaValues.bmat
 - makePessimal.r
 - makeOptimal.r
 - makeBoth.r
 - readEta.r
 - writing.r



config.r	sets up some global variables, specifically the filenames

By default, the optimal genome is written to optimalEcoli.fasta,
	the pessimal genome is written to pessimalEcoli.fasta


ecoli.fasta 	is the ecoli genome. This could easily be replaced with any other genome, so long as the format is the same. The file should look something like this:
	>alr
	ATGCAAGCGGCAACTGTTGTGATTAACCGCCGCGCTCTGCGACACAACCTGCAACGTCTT
	CGTGAACTGGCCCCTGCCAGTAAAATGGTTGCGGTGGTGAAAGCGAACGCTTATGGTCAC
	. . .
	AGCGCTTACGAACTTATTACGCGCCTGACTTCAAGGGTCGCGATGAAATACGTGGATTAA
	>modB
	ATGATACTGACCGATCCAGAATGGCAGGCAGTTTTATTAAGCCTGAAAGTTTCTTCCCTG
	. . .


etaValues.bmat 	is generated by the cubfits package. It has values for the relative pausing time (Ribosome Overhead Cost or ROC). The first few lines should look something like this:
	Parameter,Value,SD
	A.GCA.log.mu,0.457816322874014,0.0507140714477252
	A.GCC.log.mu,0.870265351752293,0.0818355617564951
	A.GCG.log.mu,1.12144948134244,0.0633143778940195
	. . .
		if instead of "A.GCA.log.mu", you just see "A", you're using an older version of cubfits.


makePessimal.r 	takes in ecoli.fasta and makes a version with the longest pausing time (ROC)
makeOptimal.r 	takes in ecoli.fasta and makes a version with the shortest pausing time (ROC)
makeBoth.r 	takes in ecoli.fasta and makes both versions


readEta.r 	reads the eta values file to find the codons with the highest and lowest pausing time

writing.r 	contains functions copied from the cubfits package
